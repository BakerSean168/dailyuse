## Findings disposition

| ID | PR | Finding | Verdict |
|----|----|---------|---------|
| P-A | #243 | loopback HTTP not gated by LOCAL_VALIDATION (security) | **FIXED** — trust branch now `env.LOCAL_VALIDATION && (loopbackHttp ∥ MagicDNS)`; +no-flag reject test. env.schema 15/15 |
| P-B | #237 | infra imports application error (WalletAccountNotFoundError) | **FIXED** — moved to `domain/errors/` (extends ResultErrorException), 3 consumers updated; boundary audit 0 violations |
| P-C | #237 | abort classifier misses runtime's structured CANCELED/aborted markers | **FIXED** — accept `code==='CANCELED'` / `category==='aborted'` (structured only, no message branching); +→ quiet abort |
| P-D | #234 | missing migration for account_closure_operation.last_error_code | **FIXED** — deploy path is `prisma db push` (schema reconcile) which propagates it; added explicit `add-account-closure-last-error-code.sql` with correct physical table (`reliable_account_closure_operations`) |
| P-E | #236 | presentErrorMessage drops legacy code fallbacks | **FIXED** — resolve `resolveResultErrorCodeFallback(code)` first; +alias test |
| P-F | #235 | translateResultErrorMessage raw fallback | **NO-CHANGE** (assessed) — all presentation call sites supply fallbackKey; raw branch is documented legacy contract pinned by test; changing would regress |

#238 was CLEAN (no findings).

## Validation
- env.schema 15/15 (incl new no-flag loopback reject); api 301; goal 525; http-client 35; app-vue AI 342; database 13 — all pass, typecheck clean.
- boundary-audit: 663 files, 0 violations.
- inventory-audit: passed, `{UI_RAW_RESULT_MESSAGE:1}` (pre-existing permanent desktop error-boundary entry), DOMAIN/RETHROW 0.
- No test-inventory regeneration needed (no new test files; only modified existing specs + a new SQL migration + moved error file).

## Gate
Review-driven fixes pass. GPT-5.6 second review of ALL batches (234-244) is now complete; all
confirmed findings fixed. The gpt-5.6 review channel is validated as high-value (caught 2 real
security/layer regressions this round).
