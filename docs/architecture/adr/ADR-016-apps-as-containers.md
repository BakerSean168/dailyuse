# ADR-016: Apps as Containers & Atomic Architecture

## Status
Accepted (updated 2026-05-26)

## Context
The project uses an Nx Monorepo structure, but there is a risk of treating it as a "Polyrepo" by putting too much logic inside `apps/`.
This leads to:
1.  Low code reusability (logic trapped in `apps/web` cannot be used in `apps/desktop`).
2.  Slow CI/CD (changing one component rebuilds the whole app).
3.  Blurred architectural boundaries.

## Decision
We adopt the **"Apps as Containers"** philosophy, combined with strict **DDD Layering**.

### 1. The Role of `apps/`
Applications are **strictly containers** — runtime shells that wire packages together.
- **Allowed Content**:
    - Entry points (`main.ts`, `index.tsx`, `app.py`).
    - Dependency Injection configuration (wiring domain to infrastructure).
    - Environment variables config.
    - Global routing maps.
    - Runtime-specific integration (Electron IPC, Express middleware, Expo routing).
- **FORBIDDEN Content**:
    - Business Logic.
    - Domain Entities.
    - Complex UI Components (move to `packages/ui-*` or `packages/feature-*`).

### 2. Apps-as-Containers Matrix

| App | Runtime | Files | Role | Thick logic to extract |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mobile` | React Native / Expo | 32 | **Pure container** — re-exports from `@memoflow/app-react` | None. Reference implementation. |
| `web` | Vue 3 / Vite | 48 | **Thin container** — standard framework bootstrap | None significant. `platform/di-app.ts` is standard DI wiring. |
| `api` | Express / Node | 55 | **Server container** — registers domain modules via `ApiBootstrapper` | Inline schedule source executor (~150 lines, duplicated from desktop). App-local `modules/` (powersync, dashboard, ai). |
| `desktop` | Electron | 137 | **Desktop container** — two-phase shell/profile runtime | Schedule source executor (duplicated from api). Desktop-specific `profile/`, `lifecycle/`, `auth/` infrastructure. |
| `ai-service` | FastAPI / Python | 57 | **Service container** — wires AI orchestration | Business services (`GoalPlanningService`, `KnowledgeNoteService`, etc.) live inline rather than in packages. |

**Target state**: All apps should trend toward `mobile`/`web` levels of thinness. Runtime-specific integration
(Electron IPC, Express middleware) is legitimate app content; business logic is not.

### 3. Atomic Packages with DDD
We organize our `packages/` to support both horizontal scaling (Features) and vertical layering (DDD).

- **Feature Modules** (e.g., `packages/task`, `packages/goal`) are the atomic units of business logic.
- **Layers** (enforced by `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`):
    - `layer:shared`: Pure primitives, no external deps.
    - `layer:infra`: Technical plumbing, depends on shared only.
    - `layer:domain`: Business logic + composition root (api/module.ts, electron-entry).
    - `layer:ui`: Presentation, can consume all layers.
    - `layer:app`: Application shells, can consume everything.

### 4. Dependency Rule
Apps depend on Packages. Packages do NOT depend on Apps.

### 5. Known Duplication Hotspots

The schedule source executor logic (dispatching reminders, goals, tasks to notification) is duplicated
between `apps/api` and `apps/desktop`. This should be extracted to a shared package when the schedule
module's server-side shape stabilizes.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Sharing logic between API and Desktop is trivial — same package, different runtime adapter.
    - `mobile` proves the thin-container model works at scale.
    - Enforces loose coupling via layer tags.
- **Negative**:
    - Requires more boilerplate to "wire up" the app in `main.ts`.
    - Desktop's multi-profile architecture legitimately needs more app-local code than other apps.
