# TDD Test System Rollout

## Archive Note

这份计划从旧的辅助计划目录迁移而来。该 rollout 在原计划中已标记为完成，保留在归档目录中作为测试治理历史记录。

## Goal

Build a fast-feedback, Nx-first testing system for the monorepo so day-to-day work follows a clear TDD path:

1. Write a failing fast test.
2. Make the smallest change to pass it.
3. Escalate only when the changed boundary requires slower suites.

## Core Constraints

- All test entry points go through `pnpm nx ...`.
- `test` / `test:watch` stay fast and must not require real DB, browser, or cross-process setup.
- Vitest owns unit, integration, smoke, contract, IPC, main-process, and bench suites.
- Playwright owns browser E2E and sync-regression flows.
- CI gates fast suites with `affected`, then selectively runs slow suites by change boundary.

## Completion Summary

1. API fast feedback restored via app-local `vitest.config.ts`
2. Root Vitest config thinned into registry/shared infra shape
3. Shared test harness consolidated into `@dailyuse/test-utils`
4. Nx-native automation added for test target normalization

## Final Ownership Model

| Boundary changed | Primary target | Owner project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain logic, mapping, local component behavior, contract checks | `<project>:test` / `<project>:test:watch` | current changed project |
| Real DB / Prisma / transaction boundary | `task:test:integration` | `task` |
| HTTP route wiring / middleware / serialization / controller composition | `api:test:smoke` | `api` |
| Electron preload / IPC handlers | `desktop:test:ipc` | `desktop` |
| Electron main-process logic | `desktop:test:main` | `desktop` |
| Browser end-user critical flows | `web:e2e` | `web` |
| Cross-end sync regression | `web:e2e:sync` | `web` |
| Explicit perf verification | `task:test:bench` | `task` |

## Status Snapshot

- Phase 1 baseline alignment: done
- Phase 2 core target normalization: done
- Phase 3 Vitest config consolidation: done
- Phase 4 test utilities consolidation: done
- Phase 5 CI restructure: done
- Phase 6 governance and automation: done

## Validation Notes

- `pnpm test:targets:check` passed after the automation changes.
- Earlier rollout verification included `pnpm nx run api:test` and `pnpm nx run app-vue:test`.
- Some final Nx re-runs were blocked by sandbox/plugin worker environment limits during the original execution context, not by a known implementation regression.
