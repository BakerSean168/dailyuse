/**
 * Wallet account not found (goal domain layer).
 *
 * Typed provider-boundary error thrown by wallet repository implementations when
 * `recordTransaction` targets a missing account. Defined in the domain layer so
 * both infrastructure (which throws it) and application (which branches on it
 * with `instanceof`) can depend on it. The message text is preserved for
 * observability but control flow must use `instanceof`, never message text.
